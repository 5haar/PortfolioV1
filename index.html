                <p>Hi, my name is Shaar and I enjoy creating and contributing things onto the web. My interest in learning to program came from getting into the cryptocurrency space back in 2017 during high-school. Most of what I did financially in the crypto space was reliant on technical analysis and monitoring/analyzing other forms of chart data. After doing more research into the financial industry, I came to the conclusion that I would like to pursue a career which involves Quantitative Analysis and Trading.<br><br> Listed below are some of the languages I am currently working with:</p>

                  <p>I am proud to share my E-commerce website in this portfolio because of the amount of time and effort I put into learning and piecing together the concepts that I used to complete the site. While mapping out and building this website, the creative process involved really showcased the different tools and skills we have been taught and have learned throughout the apprenticeship. By putting our skills to the absolute test in giving us the E-commerce project, any potential lack of skill showed itself and pointed to areas where we may have an opportunity to grow. I pushed myself to the absolute limit when completing this assignment and I included not only what was required, but what was also optional such as a slideshow. I used HTML, CSS and for the first time I also utilized a little JavaScript in my website. This was really a big step for me, and it really showcases the effort I put in to create the website. Like most designers, I am very picky with the work that I put out and attach to my name. I really had to make some decisions on whether to include certain features in the website due to time constraints. In the end, I am very pleased with my result and I look forward to utilizing the same mindset moving forward in the program to further sharpen my skills and become better than I already am. </p>
